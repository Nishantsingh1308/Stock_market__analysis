🔧 Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identify missing data, outliers, and statistical summaries

Understand distributions and correlations

📉 Machine Learning Models
🔹 Linear Regression: Predict stock prices based on time series data

🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classify stock movement categories

🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Predict based on similar historical data

📈 Data Visualization (Plotly)
Line Charts, Scatter Plots, Pie Charts, Box Plots, etc.

Storytelling using annotations and labeled trends

📊 Power BI Dashboard
Interactive visuals with slicers (Sector, Date, etc.)

Tooltips, grid snapping, alignment tools, and formatted axes

Enhanced aesthetic settings and user-friendly layout

📊 Visual Storytelling (Power BI)
Each visual answers a key question:

Bar Chart: Which companies dominate by Market Cap?

Pie/Donut Chart: How are stocks distributed across sectors?

Line Chart: What trends can we observe over time?

Scatter Plot: Is there a relationship between Market Cap and Volume?

Area Chart: How does sector volume change over time?

Slicers allow dynamic filtering of all visuals by Sector or Date, improving the interactivity and exploration.
